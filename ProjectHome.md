### Project ###
Let It Bee Project has been developed by Bogazici University Software Engineering students for the "Software Development as a Team" course.

### Aim ###
The aim of this project is to develop and deploy a web application which may be used by a community as a medium for exchanging services and goods within the community. This application will be modelled as Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS). For more information visit the [Project Proposal](ProposalWikified.md) page.

### Requirements ###
The requirements of the project were prepared in a screen based manner. You may find the requirements and links to the mockups [here](ScreenBasedRequirements.md).

### Project Plan ###
Although a project plan was prepared for the course, it was not followed and currently is not available due to it being only on one of the members' computer which was recklessly re-formatted sometime during the project.

### Development Environment ###
The project is based on Play! Framework. The developers (with some exceptions) will be eternally grateful to Play's creators. For more information you may visit http://www.playframework.org/
